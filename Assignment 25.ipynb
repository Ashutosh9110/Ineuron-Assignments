    "\n",
    "Ans: 1. List comprehensions in square brackets produce the result list all at once in memory. When they are enclosed\n",
    "in parentheses instead, they are actually generator expressions—they have a similar meaning but do not produce the \n",
    "result list all at once. Instead, generator expressions return a generator object, which yields one item in the\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans: 2. Generators are iterable objects that support the iteration protocol automatically—they have an iterator \n",
    "with a __next__ method (next in 2.X) that repeatedly advances to the next item in a series of results and raises\n",
    "an exception at the end of the series. In Python, we can code generator functions with def and yield, generator \n",

    "Ans: 4. When present, this statement makes Python compile the function specially as a generator; when called, \n",
    "the function returns a generator object that supports the iteration protocol. When the yield statement is run, \n",
    "it sends a result back to the caller and suspends the function’s state; the function can then be resumed after \n",

    "5) What is the relationship between map calls and list comprehensions? Make a comparison and\n",
    "contrast between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: 5. The map call is similar to a list comprehension—both produce a series of values, by collecting the results \n",
    "of applying an operation to each item in a sequence or other iterable, one item at a time. The primary difference \n",
    "is that map applies a function call to each item, and list comprehensions apply arbitrary expressions. Because of this, \n",
    "list comprehensions are more general; they can apply a function call expression like map, but map requires a function \n",
    "to apply other kinds of expressions. List comprehensions also support extended syntax such as nestedfor loops and \n",
    "if clauses that subsume the filter built-in. In Python 3.X, map also differs in that it produces a generator of values; \n",
    "the list comprehension materializes the result list in memory all at once. In 2.X, both tools create result lists."
